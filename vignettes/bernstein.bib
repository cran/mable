abstract = {Summary The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

    abstract = { In standard multivariate statistical analysis, common hypotheses of interest concern changes in mean vectors and subvectors. In compositional data analysis it is now well established that compositional change is most readily described in terms of the simplicial operation of perturbation and that subcompositions replace the marginal concept of subvectors. Against the background of two motivating experimental studies in the food industry, involving the compositions of cow’s milk and chicken carcasses, this paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing this fundamental operation of change in the associated simplex sample space. Well-defined hypotheses about the nature of any compositional effect can be expressed, for example, in terms of perturbation values and subcompositional stability and testing procedures developed. These procedures are applied to lattices of such hypotheses in the two practical situations. We identify the two problems as being the counterpart of the analysis of paired comparison or split plot experiments and of separate sample comparative experiments in the jargon of standard multivariate analysis. }

The goal of this paper is to present the utilities of the R package multimode, which collects different exploratory and testing non-parametric approaches for determining the number of modes and their estimated location. Specifically, some graphical tools (SiZer map, mode tree or mode forest) are provided, allowing for the identification of mode patterns, based on the kernel density estimation. Several formal testing procedures for determining the number of modes are described in this paper and implemented in the multimode package, including methods based on the ideas of the critical bandwidth, the excess mass or using a combination of both. This package also includes a function for estimating the modes locations and different classical data examples that have been considered in mode testing literature.},

These estimators are studied from the point of view of their mean integrated squared error on {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}R. A model selection method is described and proved to perform an automatic bias variance compromise. Then, we present another collection of estimators, of deconvolution type, for which we define another model selection strategy. Although the minimax asymptotic rates of these two types of estimators are mainly equivalent, the complexity of the Hermite estimators is usually much lower than the complexity of their deconvolution (or kernel) counterparts. These results are illustrated through a small simulation study.",

abstract = {ABSTRACT. The problem of boundary bias is associated with kernel estimation for regression curves with compact support. This paper proposes a simple and uni(r)ed approach for remedying boundary bias in non-parametric regression, without dividing the compact support into interior and boundary areas and without applying explicitly different smoothing treatments separately. The approach uses the beta family of density functions as kernels. The shapes of the kernels vary according to the position where the curve estimate is made. Theyare symmetric at the middle of the support interval, and become more and more asymmetric nearer the boundary points. The kernels never put any weight outside the data support interval, and thus avoid boundary bias. The method is a generalization of classical Bernstein polynomials, one of the earliest methods of statistical smoothing. The proposed estimator has optimal mean integrated squared error at an order of magnitude n−4/5, equivalent to that of standard kernel estimators when the curve has an unbounded support.},

In this paper, the author proposes a data-based method for choosing the smoothing parametrization to be used in the kernel density estimator. The procedure is fully illustrated by a simulation study and some real data examples. Il y a plusieurs niveaux de raffinement possible lorsque nous devons spécifier la matrice de la largeur de fenêtre, H, à utiliser dans un estimateur par le noyau d'une densité multidimensionnelle. Les choix possibles pour H sont: un multiple positif de la matrice identité, une matrice diagonale avec des entrées positives ou, dans la forme plus générale, une matrice symétrique définie positive. Dans cet article, nous proposons une méthode adaptative pour choisir la paramétrisation de lissage à utiliser dans l'estimateur par le noyau. La méthode est illustrée à l'aide d'une étude de simulation et quelques vrais jeux de données.},

Both simulated and real examples are presented in which the behaviour of our approach is illustrated, which shows the advantage of the new estimator over existing proposed methods.},

In this paper we show that the uncategorised data can be treated as auxiliary information, as in survey sampling literature. We establish a framework of parametric and nonparametric estimation by the empirical likelihood. The proposed empirical likelihood estimators improve the efficiency of estimators based on the categorised samples in the leading order. In a comparative study with the ratio estimator, we show the reveal robust performance of the empirical likelihood estimators. Applications to tax-auditing and to genetic studies are discussed.},

These statistics consider not only the goodness-of-fit of the joint distribution but also the goodness-of-fit of all marginal distributions, and can be regarded as generalizations of the multivariate Cramér–von Mises statistic. Simulation shows that these generalizations, using the Monte Carlo test procedure to approximate their finite-sample p-values, are more powerful than the multivariate Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic.}

This correction can be quickly evaluated, and hence it is suitable for the computation of practically exact p-values when testing simple goodness of fit. Similar findings hold for Watson's rotationally invariant modification, where a sample size of 4 appears to suffice.},

 abstract = {The performance of multivariate kernel density estimates depends crucially on the choice of bandwidth matrix, but progress towards developing good bandwidth matrix selectors has been relatively slow. In particular, previous studies of cross-validation (CV) methods have been restricted to biased and unbiased CV selection of diagonal bandwidth matrices. However, for certain types of target density the use of full (i.e. unconstrained) bandwidth matrices offers the potential for significantly improved density estimation. In this paper, we generalize earlier work from diagonal to full bandwidth matrices, and develop a smooth cross-validation (SCV) methodology for multivariate data. We consider optimization of the SCV technique with respect to a pilot bandwidth matrix. All the CV methods are studied using asymptotic analysis, simulation experiments and real data analysis. The results suggest that SCV for full bandwidth matrices is the most reliable of the CV methods. We also observe that experience from the univariate setting can sometimes be a misleading guide for understanding bandwidth selection in the multivariate case.},

Expectation–maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the Bernstein copula are proposed, and a local convergence property is proved. Moreover, asymptotic properties of the proposed semiparametric estimators are provided. Illustrative examples are presented using three real data sets and a 3-dimensional simulated data set. These studies show that the Bernstein copula is able to represent various distributions flexibly and that the proposed EM algorithms work well for such data.}

abstract = {Abstract In biomedical studies, testing for homogeneity between two groups, where one group is modeled by mixture models, is often of great interest. This paper considers the semiparametric exponential family mixture model proposed by Hong et al. (2017) and studies the score test for homogeneity under this model. The score test is nonregular in the sense that nuisance parameters disappear under the null hypothesis. To address this difficulty, we propose a modification of the score test, so that the resulting test enjoys the Wilks phenomenon. In finite samples, we show that with fixed nuisance parameters the score test is locally most powerful. In large samples, we establish the asymptotic power functions under two types of local alternative hypotheses. Our simulation studies illustrate that the proposed score test is powerful and computationally fast. We apply the proposed score test to an UK ovarian cancer DNA methylation data for identification of differentially methylated CpG sites.},

A new algorithm for the lasso (γ = 1) is obtained by studying the structure of the bridge estimators. The shrinkage parameter γ and the tuning parameter λ are selected via generalized cross-validation (GCV). Comparison between the bridge model (γ ≥ 1) and several other shrinkage models, namely the ordinary least squares regression (λ = 0), the lasso (γ = 1) and ridge regression (γ = 2), is made through a simulation study. It is shown that the bridge regression performs well compared to the lasso and ridge regression. These methods are demonstrated through an analysis of a prostate cancer data. Some computational advantages and limitations are discussed.},

The measures are able to capture positive as well as negative association. In case the random vectors are just random variables, the measures reduce to Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rho. Nonparametric estimators, based on ranks, for the measures are derived. Their large-sample asymptotics are derived and their small-sample behavior is investigated by simulation. The measures are applied to characterize strength and direction of association of northern and southern European bond markets during the recent Euro crisis as well as association of stock markets with bond markets.}

Any distribution with bounded and smooth enough density can be approximated by the proposed model which turns out to be a mixture of the beta distributions, beta, , for some optimal degree m. A simple change-point estimating method for choosing the optimal degree m of the approximate model is presented. The proposed method gives a maximum likelihood density estimate which is consistent in distance at a nearly parametric rate under some conditions. Simulation study shows that one can benefit from both the smoothness and the efficiency by using the proposed method which can also be used to estimate some population parameters such as the mean. The proposed methods are applied to three data sets of different types. }

abstract = {Abstract We consider the multi-class classification problem when the training data and the out-of-sample test data may have different distributions and propose a method called BCOPS (balanced and conformal optimized prediction sets). BCOPS constructs a prediction set C(x) as a subset of class labels, possibly empty. It tries to optimize the out-of-sample performance, aiming to include the correct class and to detect outliers x as often as possible. BCOPS returns no prediction (corresponding to C(x) equal to the empty set) if it infers x to be an outlier. The proposed method combines supervised learning algorithms with conformal prediction to minimize a misclassification loss averaged over the out-of-sample distribution. The constructed prediction sets have a finite sample coverage guarantee without distributional assumptions. We also propose a method to estimate the outlier detection rate of a given procedure. We prove asymptotic consistency and optimality of our proposals under suitable assumptions and illustrate our methods on real data examples.},

 abstract = {Non-parametric estimates of mixing proportions based on kernel-type density estimators are badly suited to several types of data. They suffer from aberrations due to rounding or truncation of the measurements, and their construction involves the crucial choice of the "window size", or smoothing parameter. In many circumstances estimators based on the empiric distribution function would be more suitable, and in this paper we investigate their properties. The estimators we introduce lead in a natural way to non-parametric forms of well-known parametric estimators. Their efficiency approaches 100 per cent as the distances between the component distributions increase.},

A small Monte Carlo study shows that when the known samples represent as little as 10% of the total sample considerable gains in efficiency are possible over the estimates computed from the no known data sample.

Abstract = {Abstract: We propose and study properties of maximum likelihood estimators in the class of conditional transformation models. Based on a suitable explicit parameterization of the unconditional or conditional transformation function, we establish a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models that can be estimated, compared and analysed in the maximum likelihood framework. Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable can be set up and estimated in the same theoretical and computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterization thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum likelihood‐b},

 abstract={evmix is an R package (R Core Team 2017) with two interlinked toolsets: i) for extreme value modeling and ii) kernel density estimation. A key issue in univariate extreme value modeling is the choice of threshold beyond which the asymptotically motivated extreme value models provide a suitable tail approximation. The package implements almost all existing extreme value mixture models, which permit objective threshold estimation and uncertainty quantification. Some traditional diagnostic plots for threshold choice are provided. Kernel density estimation with a range of kernels is provided, including cross-validation maximum likelihood inference for the bandwidth. A key contribution over existing kernel smoothing packages in R is that a wide range of boundary corrected kernel density estimators are implemented, which are designed for populations with bounded support. These non-parametric density estimators are also incorporated into the extreme value mixture model framework to describe the density below the threshold. The quartet of density, distribution, quantile and random number generation functions is provided along with parameter estimation by likelihood inference and standard model fit diagnostics, for both the mixture models and kernel density estimators. The key features of the mixture models and (boundary corrected) kernel density estimators are described and their implementation using the package demonstrated.},

We propose using kernels that are symmetric in their two arguments; these kernels are conditional densities of bivariate copulas. We give asymptotic theory for the version of the new estimator using Gaussian copula kernels and report on simulation comparisons of it with the beta-kernel density estimator of Chen (1999). We also provide automatic bandwidth selection in the form of 'rule-of-thumb' bandwidths for both estimators. As well as its competitive integrated squared error performance, advantages of the new approach include its greater range of possible values at 0 and 1, the fact that it is a bona fide density and that the individual kernels and resulting estimator are comprehensible in terms of a single simple picture.},

For this I first derive a recursive formula for the raw moments from the moment generating function. Then it is shown that the recursion involved is essentially the same as for the Stirling numbers of the second kind. From this fact it is then possible to derive the closed formulae. Finally, I discuss an application of these formulae to the analysis of neural associative memory.},

abstract = {The problem of computing empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) efficiently on large, multivariate datasets, is revisited. Computing an ECDF at one evaluation point requires O(N) operations on a dataset composed of N data points. Therefore, a direct evaluation of ECDFs at N evaluation points requires a quadratic O(N2) operations, which is prohibitive for large-scale problems. Two fast and exact methods are proposed and compared. The first one is based on fast summation in lexicographical order, with a O(Nlog⁡N) complexity and requires the evaluation points to lie on a regular grid. The second one is based on the divide-and-conquer principle, with a O(Nlog⁡(N)(d−1)∨1) complexity and requires the evaluation points to coincide with the input points. The two fast algorithms are described and detailed in the general d-dimensional case, and numerical experiments validate their speed and accuracy. Secondly, a direct connection between cumulative distribution functions and kernel density estimation (KDE) is established for a large class of kernels. This connection paves the way for fast exact algorithms for multivariate kernel density estimation and kernel regression. Numerical tests with the Laplacian kernel validate the speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithms. A broad range of large-scale multivariate density estimation, cumulative distribution estimation, survival function estimation and regression problems can benefit from the proposed numerical methods.}

 abstract = {We consider estimation in a bivariate mixture model in which the component distributions can be decomposed into identical distributions. Previous approaches to estimation involve parametrizing the distributions. In this paper, we use a semi-parametric approach. The method is based on the exponential tilt model of Anderson (1979), where the log ratio of probability (density) functions from the bivariate components is linear in the observations. The proposed model does not require training samples, i.e., data with confirmed component membership. We show that in bivariate mixture models, parameters are identifiable. This is in contrast to previous works, where parameters are identifiable if and only if each univariate marginal model is identifiable (Teicher (1967)).},

abstract = {Given a large sample of observations from an unknown univariate continuous distribution, it is often of interest to empirically estimate the global mode of the underlying density. Applications include samples obtained by Monte Carlo methods with independent observations, or Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with weakly dependent samples from the underlying stationary density. In either case, often the generating density is not available in closed form and only empirical determination of the mode is possible. Assuming that the generating density has a unique global mode, a non-parametric estimate of the density is proposed based on a sequence of mixtures of Beta densities which allows for the estimation of the mode even when the mode is possibly located on the boundary of the support of the density. Furthermore, the estimated mode is shown to be strongly universally consistent under a set of mild regularity conditions. The proposed method is compared with other empirical estimates of the mode based on popular kernel density estimates. Numerical results based on extensive simulation studies show benefits of the proposed methods in terms of empirical bias, standard errors and computation time. An R package implementing the method is also made available online.}

ABSTRACT = {In the fields of finance, insurance, system reliability, etc., it is often of interest to measure the dependence among variables by modeling a multivariate distribution using a copula. The copula models with parametric assumptions are easy to estimate but can be highly biased when such assumptions are false, while the empirical copulas are nonsmooth and often not genuine copulas, making the inference about dependence challenging in practice. As a compromise, the empirical Bernstein copula provides a smooth estimator, but the estimation of tuning parameters remains elusive. The proposed empirical checkerboard copula within a hierarchical empirical Bayes model alleviates the aforementioned issues and provides a smooth estimator based on multivariate Bernstein polynomials that itself is shown to be a genuine copula. Additionally, the proposed copula estimator is shown to provide a more accurate estimate of several multivariate dependence measures. Both theoretical asymptotic properties and finite-sample performances of the proposed estimator based on simulated data are presented and compared with some nonparametric estimators. An application to portfolio risk management is included based on stock prices data.},

abstract = {To quantify the dependence between two random vectors of possibly different dimensions, we propose to rely on the properties of the 2-Wasserstein distance. We first propose two coefficients that are based on the Wasserstein distance between the actual distribution and a reference distribution with independent components. The coefficients are normalised to take values between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the maximal amount of dependence possible given the two multivariate margins. We then make a quasi-Gaussian assumption that yields two additional coefficients rooted in the same ideas as the first two. These different coefficients are more amenable for distributional results and admit attractive formulas in terms of the joint covariance or correlation matrix. Furthermore, maximal dependence is proved to occur at the covariance matrix with minimal von Neumann entropy given the covariance matrices of the two multivariate margins. This result also helps us revisit the RV coefficient by proposing a sharper normalisation. The two coefficients based on the quasi-Gaussian approach can be estimated easily via the empirical covariance matrix. The estimators are asymptotically normal and their asymptotic variances are explicit functions of the covariance matrix, which can thus be estimated consistently too. The results extend to the Gaussian copula case, in which case the estimators are rank-based. The results are illustrated through theoretical examples. Monte Carlo simulations and a case study involving electroencephalography data are proposed in the supplementary material.}

abstract = {We study theoretically, for the first time, the Dirichlet kernel estimator introduced by Aitchison and Lauder (1985) for the estimation of multivariate densities supported on the d-dimensional simplex. The simplex is an important case as it is the natural domain of compositional data and has been neglected in the literature on asymmetric kernels. The Dirichlet kernel estimator, which generalizes the (non-modified) unidimensional Beta kernel estimator from Chen (1999), is free of boundary bias and non-negative everywhere on the simplex. We show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate O(n−4/(d+4)) for the mean squared error and the mean integrated squared error, we prove its asymptotic normality and uniform strong consistency, and we also find an asymptotic expression for the mean integrated absolute error. To illustrate the Dirichlet kernel method and its favorable boundary properties, we present a case study on minerals processing.}

abstract = {Bernstein estimators are well-known to avoid the boundary bias problem of traditional kernel estimators. The theoretical properties of these estimators have been studied extensively on compact intervals and hypercubes, but never on the simplex, except for the mean squared error of the density estimator in Tenbusch (1994) when d=2. The simplex is an important case as it is the natural domain of compositional data. In this paper, we make an effort to prove several asymptotic results (bias, variance, mean squared error (MSE), mean integrated squared error (MISE), asymptotic normality, uniform strong consistency) for Bernstein estimators of cumulative distribution functions and density functions on the d-dimensional simplex. Our results generalize the ones in Leblanc (2012a) and Babu et al. (2002), who treated the case d=1, and significantly extend those found in Tenbusch (1994). In particular, our rates of convergence for the MSE and MISE are optimal.}

abstract = {Recent literature on semiparametric copula models focused on the situation when the marginals are specified nonparametrically and the copula function is given a parametric form. For example, this setup is used in Chen, Fan and Tsyrennikov (2006) [Efficient Estimation of Semiparametric Multivariate Copula Models, JASA] who focus on efficient estimation of copula parameters. We consider a reverse situation when the marginals are specified parametrically and the copula function is modelled nonparametrically. This setting is no less relevant in applications. We use the method of sieve for efficient estimation of parameters in marginals, derive its asymptotic distribution and show that the estimator is semiparametrically efficient. Simulations suggest that the sieve MLE can be up to 40% more efficient relative to QMLE depending on the strength of dependence between the marginals. An application using insurance company loss and expense data demonstrates empirical relevance of this setting.},

abstract = {Summary Malaria remains a major epidemiologic problem in many developing countries. Malaria is defined as the presence of parasites and symptoms (usually fever) due to the parasites. In endemic areas, an individual may have symptoms attributable either to malaria or to other causes. From a clinical viewpoint, it is important to correctly diagnose an individual who has developed symptoms so that the appropriate treatments can be given. From an epidemiologic and economic viewpoint, it is important to determine the proportion of malaria-affected cases in individuals who have symptoms so that policies on intervention program can be developed. Once symptoms have developed in an individual, the diagnosis of malaria can be based on the analysis of the parasite levels in blood samples. However, even a blood test is not conclusive as in endemic areas many healthy individuals can have parasites in their blood slides. Therefore, data from this type of study can be viewed as coming from a mixture distribution, with the components corresponding to malaria and nonmalaria cases. A unique feature in this type of data, however, is the fact that a proportion of the nonmalaria cases have zero parasite levels. Therefore, one of the component distributions is itself a mixture distribution. In this article, we propose a semiparametric likelihood approach for estimating the proportion of clinical malaria using parasite-level data from a group of individuals with symptoms. Our approach assumes the density ratio for the parasite levels in clinical malaria and nonclinical malaria cases can be modeled using a logistic model. We use empirical likelihood to combine the zero and nonzero data. The maximum semiparametric likelihood estimate is more efficient than existing nonparametric estimates using only the frequencies of zero and nonzero data. On the other hand, it is more robust than a fully parametric maximum likelihood estimate that assumes a parametric model for the nonzero data. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactory. The proposed method is used to analyze data from a malaria survey carried out in Tanzania.},

 abstract = {We consider a problem of testing mixture proportions using two-sample data, one from group one and the other from a mixture of groups one and two with unknown proportion, λ, for being in group two. Various statistical applications, including microarray study, infectious epidemiological studies, case-control studies with contaminated controls, clinical trials allowing "nonresponders," genetic studies for gene mutation, and fishery applications can be formulated in this setup. Under the assumption that the log ratio of probability (density) functions from the two groups is linear in the observations, we propose a generalized score test statistic to test the mixture proportion. Under some regularity conditions, it is shown that this statistic converges to a weighted chi-squared random variable under the null hypothesis of λ = 0, where the weight depends only on the sampling fraction of both groups. The permutation method is used to provide more reliable finite sample approximation. Simulation results and two real data applications are presented.},

abstract = {Given a sample from a continuous multivariate distribution F, the uniform random variates generated independently and rearranged in the order specified by the componentwise ranks of the original sample look like a sample from the copula of F. This idea can be regarded as a variant on Baker’s [J. Multivariate Anal. 99 (2008) 2312–2327] copula construction and leads to the definition of the empirical beta copula. The latter turns out to be a particular case of the empirical Bernstein copula, the degrees of all Bernstein polynomials being equal to the sample size. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a Bernstein polynomial to be a copula. These imply that the empirical beta copula is a genuine copula. Furthermore, the empirical process based on the empirical Bernstein copula is shown to be asymptotically the same as the ordinary empirical copula process under assumptions which are significantly weaker than those given in Janssen, Swanepoel and Veraverbeke [J. Statist. Plann. Inference 142 (2012) 1189–1197]. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that the empirical beta copula outperforms the empirical copula and the empirical checkerboard copula in terms of both bias and variance. Compared with the empirical Bernstein copula with the smoothing rate suggested by Janssen et al., its finite-sample performance is still significantly better in several cases, especially in terms of bias.}

 abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

The algorithm is designed to be executed on a linear array of m processors, each having constant size memory, and each being responsible for producing one element of a given combination. There is a constant delay per combination, leading to an O(C(m, n)) time solution, where C(m,n) is the total number of combinations. The algorithm is cost optimal (assuming the time to output the combinations is counted), does not deal with very large integers, and is much simpler than the previously known solutions that enjoy same properties.}

Both the cases of a multivariate d. f. under equal grouping on all co-ordinates and a one-dimensional d. f. under unequal grouping are considered. These are extensions to Lindley's results of 1949. The procedure requires that for any particular d. f. and grouping set-up, a correction factor, usually depending on the grouping width, be calculated. This factor when added to a specific initial estimate should provide reasonably close approximations to the m. l. estimates under grouping. The sampling variances of these approximations are also obtained and they are found to depend, in part, on the squares of the interval widths.},

However, other important aspects of the family, such as marginal and conditional distributions and related properties are not yet available in the literature. Moreover, diverse applications of the family to the real world need to be further explored. In this paper, we first obtain the marginal and conditional distributions and other related properties of the nested Dirichlet distribution. We then present new applications of the family in fitting competing-risks model, analyzing incomplete categorical data and evaluating cancer diagnosis tests. Three real data involving failure times of radio transmitter receivers, attitude toward the death penalty and ultrasound ratings for breast cancer metastasis are provided.}

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of a smooth function  f  and a convex function  P  of  n  real variables subject to  m  linear equality constraints. We propose a block-coordinate gradient descent method for solving this problem, with the coordinate block chosen by a Gauss-Southwell-  q  rule based on sufficient predicted descent. We establish global convergence to first-order stationarity for this method and, under a local error bound assumption, linear rate of convergence. If  f  is convex with Lipschitz continuous gradient, then the method terminates in  O (  n  2/  ) iterations with an  -optimal solution. If  P  is separable, then the Gauss-Southwell-  q  rule is implementable in  O (  n ) operations when  m =1 and in  O (  n  2) operations when  m >1. In the special case of support vector machines training, for which  f  is convex quadratic,  P  is separable, and  m =1, this complexity bound is comparable to the best known bound for decomposition methods. If  f  is convex, then, by gradually reducing the weight on  P  to zero, the method can be adapted to solve the bilevel problem of minimizing  P  over the set of minima of  f +     X  , where  X  denotes the closure of the feasible set. This has application in the least 1-norm solution of maximum-likelihood estimation.},

abstract = {Malaria illness can be diagnosed by the presence of fever and parasitaemia. However, in highly endemic areas the diagnosis of clinical malaria can be difficult since children may tolerate parasites without fever and may have fever due to other causes. We propose a novel, simulation-based Bayesian approach for obtaining precise estimates of the probabilities of children with different levels of parasitaemia having fever due to malaria, by formulating the problem as a mixture of distributions. The methodology suggested is a general methodology for decomposing any two-component mixture distribution nonparametrically, when an independent training sample is available from one of the components. It is based on the assumption that one of the component distributions lies on the left of the other but there is some overlap between the distributions.},

On the other hand, the accelerated failure time model, which simply regresses the logarithm of the survival time over the covariates, has seldom been utilized in the analysis of censored survival data. In this article, we review some newly developed linear regression methods for analysing failure time observations. These procedures have sound theoretical justification and can be implemented with an efficient numerical method. The accelerated failure time model has an intuitive physical interpretation and would be a useful alternative to the Cox model in survival analysis.},

In the literature, most of the existing copulas are symmetric while data collected from the real world may exhibit asymmetric nature. This necessitates developing asymmetric copulas that can model such data. In the meantime, existing methods of modelling two-dimensional reliability data are not able to capture the tail dependence that exists between the pair of age and usage, which are the two dimensions designated to describe product life. This paper proposes a new method of constructing asymmetric copulas, discusses the properties of the new copulas, and applies the method to fit two-dimensional reliability data that are collected from the real world.}

abstract = {Existing works on multivariate distributions mainly focus on limited distribution functions and require that the associated marginal distributions belong to the same family. Although this simplifies problems, it may fail to deal with practical cases when the marginal distributions are arbitrary. To this end, copula function is employed since it provides a flexible way in decoupling the marginal distributions and dependence structure for random variables. Among different copula functions, most researches focus on Gaussian, Student's t and Archimedean copulas for simplicity. In this paper, to extend bivariate copula families, we have constructed new bivariate copulas for exponential, Weibull and Rician distributions. We have proved that the three copula functions of exponential, Rayleigh and Weibull distributions are equivalent, constrained by only one parameter, thus greatly facilitating practical applications of them. We have also proved that the copula function of log-normal distribution is equivalent to the Gaussian copula. Moreover, we have derived the Rician copula with two parameters. In addition, the modified Bessel function or incomplete Gamma function with double integrals in the copula functions are simplified by single integral or infinite series for computational efficiency. Associated copula density functions for exponential, Rayleigh, Weibull, log-normal, Nakagami-m and Rician distributions are also derived.}

Moreover, a novel method for optimal copula selection is also proposed, based on the criterion that for a given series of copulas, the optimal copula will have its copula density based mutual information closest to the corresponding bivariate distribution based mutual information. The corresponding bivariate distribution is the bivariate distribution that is used to derive this copula. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes’ information criterion (BIC) are compared with the proposed mutual information based criterion for optimal copula selection. In addition, several case studies are also presented to further validate the effectiveness of the copulas, which include dual branch selection combining diversity using Nakagami-m, exponential/Rayleigh/Weibull and Rician copulas with different marginal distributions as in real applications.}
