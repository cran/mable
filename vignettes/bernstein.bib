 abstract="In this paper, our aim is to revisit the nonparametric estimation of a square integrable density f on {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}R, by using projection estimators on a Hermite basis. These estimators are studied from the point of view of their mean integrated squared error on {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}R. A model selection method is described and proved to perform an automatic bias variance compromise. Then, we present another collection of estimators, of deconvolution type, for which we define another model selection strategy. Although the minimax asymptotic rates of these two types of estimators are mainly equivalent, the complexity of the Hermite estimators is usually much lower than the complexity of their deconvolution (or kernel) counterparts. These results are illustrated through a small simulation study.",

abstract = {ABSTRACT. The problem of boundary bias is associated with kernel estimation for regression curves with compact support. This paper proposes a simple and uni(r)ed approach for remedying boundary bias in non-parametric regression, without dividing the compact support into interior and boundary areas and without applying explicitly different smoothing treatments separately. The approach uses the beta family of density functions as kernels. The shapes of the kernels vary according to the position where the curve estimate is made. Theyare symmetric at the middle of the support interval, and become more and more asymmetric nearer the boundary points. The kernels never put any weight outside the data support interval, and thus avoid boundary bias. The method is a generalization of classical Bernstein polynomials, one of the earliest methods of statistical smoothing. The proposed estimator has optimal mean integrated squared error at an order of magnitude n−4/5, equivalent to that of standard kernel estimators when the curve has an unbounded support.},

For such incomplete data, the usual regression techniques such as the Cox (1972, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 34, 187-220) proportional hazards model are inapplicable. In this paper, we present a method for regression analysis which accommodates interval-censored data. We present applications of this methodology to data sets from a study of breast cancer patients who were followed for cosmetic response to therapy, a small animal tumorigenicity study, and a clinical trial.},

    abstract = { A method of parameterising and smoothing the unknown underlying distributions using Bernstein type polynomials with positive coefficients is proposed, verified and investigated. Any distribution with bounded and smooth enough density can be approximated by the proposed model which turns out to be a mixture of the beta distributions, beta, , for some optimal degree m. A simple change-point estimating method for choosing the optimal degree m of the approximate model is presented. The proposed method gives a maximum likelihood density estimate which is consistent in distance at a nearly parametric rate under some conditions. Simulation study shows that one can benefit from both the smoothness and the efficiency by using the proposed method which can also be used to estimate some population parameters such as the mean. The proposed methods are applied to three data sets of different types. }

Abstract = {Abstract: We propose and study properties of maximum likelihood estimators in the class of conditional transformation models. Based on a suitable explicit parameterization of the unconditional or conditional transformation function, we establish a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models that can be estimated, compared and analysed in the maximum likelihood framework. Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable can be set up and estimated in the same theoretical and computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterization thereof. The ability to evaluate the distribution function directly allows us to estimate models based on the exact likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. For discrete and continuous responses, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. A reference software implementation of maximum likelihood‐b},

For this I first derive a recursive formula for the raw moments from the moment generating function. Then it is shown that the recursion involved is essentially the same as for the Stirling numbers of the second kind. From this fact it is then possible to derive the closed formulae. Finally, I discuss an application of these formulae to the analysis of neural associative memory.},

For example, this setup is used in Chen, Fan and Tsyrennikov (2006) [Efficient Estimation of Semiparametric Multivariate Copula Models, JASA] who focus on efficient estimation of copula parameters. We consider a reverse situation when the marginals are specified parametrically and the copula function is modelled nonparametrically. This setting is no less relevant in applications. We use the method of sieve for efficient estimation of parameters in marginals, derive its asymptotic distribution and show that the estimator is semiparametrically efficient. Simulations suggest that the sieve MLE can be up to 40% more efficient relative to QMLE depending on the strength of dependence between the marginals. An application using insurance company loss and expense data demonstrates empirical relevance of this setting.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Both the cases of a multivariate d. f. under equal grouping on all co-ordinates and a one-dimensional d. f. under unequal grouping are considered. These are extensions to Lindley's results of 1949. The procedure requires that for any particular d. f. and grouping set-up, a correction factor, usually depending on the grouping width, be calculated. This factor when added to a specific initial estimate should provide reasonably close approximations to the m. l. estimates under grouping. The sampling variances of these approximations are also obtained and they are found to depend, in part, on the squares of the interval widths.},
