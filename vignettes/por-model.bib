The assumed model allows for an arbitrary, smoothed baseline hazard on which a vector of covariates operates in a proportional manner, and thus produces an interpretable baseline hazard function along with estimates of global covariate effects. For estimation, we extend the modified EM algorithm suggested by Betensky, Lindsey, Ryan and Wand. We illustrate the method with data on times to deterioration of breast cosmeses and HIV-1 infection rates among haemophiliacs. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {An approach is presented for fitting the accelerated failure time model to interval censored data that does not involve computing the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the distribution function at the residuals. The approach involves estimating equations computed with the examination times from the same individual treated as if they had actually been obtained from different individuals. The dependence between different measurements obtained from the same individual is then accounted for in the calculation of the standard error of the regression coefficients. The approach is applicable to interval censored data in settings in which examinations continue to occur regardless of whether the failure time has occurred. Simulations are presented to assess the behaviour of the approach, and the methodology is illustrated through an application to data from an AIDS clinical trial.},

Nevertheless, AFT models have been much less utilized in practice due to lack of reliable computing methods and software. This paper describes an R package aftgee that implements recently developed inference procedures for AFT models with both the rank-based approach and the least squares approach. For the rank-based approach, the package allows various weight choices and uses an induced smoothing procedure that leads to much more efficient computation than the linear programming method. With the rank-based estimator as an initial value, the generalized estimating equation approach is used as an extension of the least squares approach to the multivariate case. Additional sampling weights are incorporated to handle missing data needed as in case-cohort studies or general sampling schemes. A simulated dataset and two real life examples from biomedical research are employed to illustrate the usage of the package.},

abstract = "Competing risks are common in clinical cancer research, as patients are subject to multiple potential failure outcomes, such as death from the cancer itself or from complications arising from the disease. In the analysis of competing risks, several regression methods are available for the evaluation of the relationship between covariates and cause-specific failures, many of which are based on Cox’s proportional hazards model. Although a great deal of research has been conducted on estimating competing risks, less attention has been devoted to linear regression modeling, which is often referred to as the accelerated failure time (AFT) model in survival literature. In this article, we address the use and interpretation of linear regression analysis with regard to the competing risks problem. We introduce two types of AFT modeling framework, where the influence of a covariate can be evaluated in relation to either a cause-specific hazard function, referred to as cause-specific AFT (CS-AFT) modeling in this study, or the cumulative incidence function of a particular failure type, referred to as crude-risk AFT (CR-AFT) modeling. Simulation studies illustrate that, as in hazard-based competing risks analysis, these two models can produce substantially different effects, depending on the relationship between the covariates and both the failure type of principal interest and competing failure types. We apply the AFT methods to data from non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, where the dataset is characterized by two competing events, disease relapse and death without relapse, and non-proportionality. We demonstrate how the data can be analyzed and interpreted, using linear competing risks regression models."

This paper describes a method of estimating the parameters @Q without assuming any functional form for the distribution function F, and proves that this estimator is consistent. F is also consistently estimated. The method uses maximum likelihood estimation in which the likelihood is maximized not only over the parameter Q but also over a space which contains all distribution functions. },

The resulting estimated density is smooth enough to be used in a practical implementation of the profile likelihood estimator, but is sufficiently close to the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator to allow estimation of the semiparametric efficient score. The parameter estimates obtained by solving the estimated score equations are then asymptotically efficient. A summary of analogous results for truncated regression is also given. },

The prevalence test commonly used to compare treatments in animal tumorigenicity experiments (Hoel and Walburg, 1972; Peto et al., 1980) is essentially equivalent to a likelihood score test derived under a logistic model that expresses tumour prevalence as a function of time and treatment. The more general regression context suggests an alternative to the convention of grouping observations into arbitrarily chosen intervals. The model also incorporates covariates, provides a framework for estimating the strength of a dose-response relationship and for testing a central assumption underlying the usual prevalence test, and is computationally simple to analyse.},

   abstract = {For right-censored data perhaps the most commonly used tests are weighted logrank tests, such as the logrank and Wilcoxon-type tests. In this paper we review several generalizations of those weighted logrank tests to interval-censored data and present an R package, interval, to implement many of them.  The interval package depends on the perm package, also presented here, which performs exact and asymptotic linear permutation tests.  The perm package performs many of the tests included in the already available coin package, and provides an independent validation of coin.  We review analysis methods for interval-censored data, and we describe and show how to use the interval and perm packages.},

In particular, these are models due to Cox [Cox (1972) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 34, 187–208], Prentice & Kalbfleisch and Cox & Oakes [Cox & Oakes (1984) Analysis of Survival Data, Chapman and Hall, London]. The model due to Prentice & Kalbfleisch [Prentice & Kalbfleisch (1979) Biometrics, 35, 25–39], which has seen very limited use, is given particular consideration. The prior for the baseline distribution in each model is taken to be a mixture of Polya trees and posterior inference is obtained through standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. They demonstrate the implementation and comparison of these three models on the celebrated Stanford heart transplant data and the study of the timing of cerebral edema diagnosis during emergency room treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis in children. An important feature of their overall discussion is the comparison of semi-parametric families, and ultimate criterion based selection of a family within the context of a given data set. Les auteurs considèrent des méthodes bayésiennes pour ajuster trois modèles de survie semi-paramétriques incorporant des covariables dépendant du temps.

Ils illustrent l'implantation de ces modèles et ils les comparent à l'aide des célèbres données de transplantation cardiaque de Stanford et sur une étude du temps de diagnostic de l'œdème cérébral lors du traitement à l'urgence d'enfants souffrant d'acidocétose diabétique. Les points importants de leur argumentation portent sur la comparaison de familles semi-paramétriques et le critère de sélection final d'une de ces familles en fonction du jeu de données.},

   abstract = {It has been well documented that ignoring measurement error may result in substantially biased estimates in many contexts including linear and nonlinear regressions. For survival data with measurement error in covariates, there has been extensive discussion in the literature with the focus typically centered on proportional hazards models. The impact of measurement error on inference under accelerated failure time models has received relatively little attention, although these models are very useful in survival data analysis. He et al. (2007) discussed accelerated failure time models with error-prone covariates and studied the bias induced by the naive approach of ignoring measurement error in covariates. To adjust for the effects of covariate measurement error, they described a simulation and extrapolation method. This method has theoretical advantages such as robustness to distributional assumptions for error prone covariates. Moreover, this method enjoys simplicity and flexibility for practical use. It is quite appealing to analysts who would like to accommodate covariate measurement error in their analysis. To implement this method, in this paper, we develop an R package for general users. Two data sets arising from clinical trials are employed to illustrate the use of the package. },

Meaningful analysis of survival experiments can be obtained by estimations of the net probability of death due to the cause of interest. A comparison of some interval techniques and a noninterval technique developed by Kaplan and Meier suggests that the latter is preferable when the actual ages-at-death are known. This representation can be analyzed for a significant difference between a treated and a control population with a nonparametric test for randomly censored data. The mean age-at-death, a summarized description of the cumulative mortality function, must also be adjusted for competing risks (diseases). Different techniques for correction of incidences of nonlethal diseases must be used, however, since changes in the mortality paHerns for lethal diseases will change the "net probabilities" for nonlethal diseases. Nonlethal diseases can be analyzed by an interval method or a noninterval method similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimate used with lethal diseases.}",

    abstract = { The accelerated failure time model is presented as an alternative to the proportional hazards model in the analysis of time to event data. A case study in influenza looking at the time to resolution of influenza symptoms is used to illustrate these considerations. The proportional hazards model displays significant lack of fit while the accelerated failure time model describes the data well. From a clinical perspective the accelerated failure time model in this and other applications is seen to be a more appropriate modeling framework and has the added advantage of being easier to interpret. It is concluded that the accelerated failure time model should be considered as an alternative to the proportional hazards model in the analysis of time to event data, especially in applications where the effects of treatment are to accelerate (or delay) the event of interest with no permanent effect in the context of the follow-up period. }

In the present paper, the rate of contraction/expansion is formulated by a parametric function of the covariate process while the baseline failure time distribution is unspecified. Estimating functions for the vector of regression parameters are motivated by likelihood score functions and take the form of log rank statistics with time-dependent covariates. The resulting estimators are proven to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. Simple methods are derived for making inference about a subset of regression parameters while regarding others as nuisance quantities. Finite-sample properties of the estimation and testing procedures are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. An illustration with the well-known Stanford heart transplant data is provided."

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a method proposed for a censored linear regression model that can be used in the context of survival analysis. The method has the important characteristic of allowing estimation and inference without knowing the distribution of the duration variable. Moreover, it does not need the assumption of proportional hazards. Therefore, it can be an interesting alternative to the Cox proportional hazards models when this assumption does not hold. In addition, implementation and interpretation of the results is simple. In order to analyse the performance of this methodology, we apply it to two real examples and we carry out a simulation study. We present its results together with those obtained with the traditional Cox model and AFT parametric models. The new proposal seems to lead to more precise results.

 abstract = {Many problems, particularly in medical research, concern the relationship between certain covariates and the time to occurrence of an event. The hazard or failure rate function provides a conceptually simple representation of time to occurrence data that readily adapts to include such generalizations as competing risks and covariates that vary with time. Two partially parametric models for the hazard function are considered. These are the proportional hazards model of Cox (1972) and the class of log-linear or accelerated failure time models. A synthesis of the literature on estimation from these models under prospective sampling indicates that, although important advances have occurred during the past decade, further effort is warranted on such topics as distribution theory, tests of fit, robustness, and the full utilization of a methodology that permits non-standard features. It is further argued that a good deal of fruitful research could be done on applying the same models under a variety of other sampling schemes. A discussion of estimation from case-control studies illustrates this point.},

The proposed estimators for the regression coefficients include a class of minimum distance estimators defined through weighted empirical odds function. We have investigated the asymptotic properties like the consistency and the limiting distribution of the proposed estimators under mild conditions. The finite sample properties were investigated through simulation study making comparison of some of the estimators in the class. We conclude with an illustration of our proposed method to a well-known AIDS data."

On the other hand, the accelerated failure time model, which simply regresses the logarithm of the survival time over the covariates, has seldom been utilized in the analysis of censored survival data. In this article, we review some newly developed linear regression methods for analysing failure time observations. These procedures have sound theoretical justification and can be implemented with an efficient numerical method. The accelerated failure time model has an intuitive physical interpretation and would be a useful alternative to the Cox model in survival analysis.},

Abstract = {The proportional hazards model (PH) is currently the most popular regression model for analyzing time-toevent data. Despite its popularity, the analysis of interval-censored data under the PH model can be challenging using many available techniques. This article presents a new method for analyzing interval-censored data under the PH model. The proposed approach uses a monotone spline representation to approximate the unknown nondecreasing cumulative baseline hazard function. Formulating the PH model in this fashion results in a finite number of parameters to estimate while maintaining substantial modeling flexibility. A novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The derivation of the EM algorithm relies on a two-stage data augmentation involving latent Poisson random variables. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement, robust to initialization, enjoys quick convergence, and provides closed-form varianc},

The resulting rank estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. However, the asymptotic variances of these estimators are complicated and are difficult to estimate well with censored data. In this paper, we propose some simple methods for making inference about a subset of the regression coefficients while regarding others as nuisance parameters. A lack-of-fit test for the linear model is also presented. The proposed procedures are illustrated with an example.},
